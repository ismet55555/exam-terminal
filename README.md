# :pencil: Exam Creation

Exams are described within examfiles.

## Examfile Format

Exam description files are made using the YAML file format (`.yml` or `.yaml`), human-readable structured data format. If you are not familiar with YAML, there are lots of sources explaining it, [here is one](https://blog.stackpath.com/yaml/#:~:text=Definition,used%20to%20write%20configuration%20files.). An example of a examfile description in YAML format [can be viewed here](exam_terminal/exams/sample_exam.yml).

The exam file should be named with the `.yml` or `.yaml` file extension.

## Exam File Structure

Examfiles have two major sections:

  1. `exam` - General information about the entire exam. This includes info like exam title or allowed exam time
  2. `questions` - Information/Description for each question. This section includes each question and available selections for that question.
  

An outline of the examfile looks like this:

```yaml
exam:
  ...
questions:
  - question: ...
    selection:
      - ...
      - ...
  - question: ...
    selection:
      - ...
      - ...
  - ...
```

## Exam File Section: `exam`

This section describes the general information about the exam. The following are the available exam descriptions.

**NOTE**: _As of now all of the exam descriptions are required_

| Item                      	| Description                                         	| Example                                    	|
|---------------------------	|-----------------------------------------------------	|--------------------------------------------	|
| `exam_title`              	| The general title of the exam                       	| `AWS Kiwi Practice Exam`                   	|
| `exam_description`        	| A longer more detailed description of the exam      	| `This exam assess your knowledge on kiwis` 	|
| `exam_author`             	| The name of the person or entity that made the exam 	| `Pappa McJameson`                          	|
| `exam_edit_date`          	| The date when the exam was last edited              	| `01/01/1970`                               	|
| `exam_allwed_time`        	| Total exam time allowed                             	| `120`                                      	|
| `exam_allowed_time_units` 	| The time units that describe `exam_allowed_time`    	| `seconds`                                  	|
| `exam_passing_score`      	| Minimum passing score percentage for the exam       	| `70`                                       	|

### Example

```yaml
exam:
  exam_title: "The One Exam"
  exam_description: This exam will assess your ability to be the one. You chose that one pill now you gotta do work and prove you can fly around the matrix and stuff.
  exam_author: "Neo"
  exam_edit_date: "06/06/2199"
  exam_allowed_time: 240
  exam_allowed_time_units: "seconds"
  exam_passing_score: 95
...
```

## Exam File Section: `questions`

This section describes each question in the exam. The following are the available options for each question:

| Item                    	| Description                                                                    	| Example                       	|
|-------------------------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|-------------------------------	|
| `question`              	| Question text shown to the exam taker                                          	| `What's your favorite color?` 	|
| `question_allowed_time` 	| (Optional) Total time allowed for the specific question in seconds             	| `60`                          	|
| `selection`             	| List of answer selections for the user.<br>Correct answers denoted by `: true` 	| `- green`<br>`- black: true`  	|

### Answer Selection

To denoted the correct answer in the `selection` section, simply add at `: true` to the end of the selection. You can have more than one correct answer, that is, multiple `: true` denoted questions.

### Example

```yaml
...
questions:
  - question: What is your hobby?
    selection:
      - Politics
      - Programming: true
      - TV
      - Chillin: true
      - Reading: true
...
```
**NOTE**: If there is more than one correct (`true`) answer, the question automatically becomes a multi-answer question, allowing the exam taker to select multiple selections.
