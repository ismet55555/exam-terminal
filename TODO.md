# TODO 

- Go back and forth with questions
- Have a answered/unanswered questions indicator 
- Set up where multiple choice selection yields something backce
- Encrypt the exam file with a password so you can send it to someone?
- Quitting exam with option to continue later -> create a temp .exam file
- Auto save to protect against crashes
- Timeout on question taking too long (maybe X% of total test ...)
